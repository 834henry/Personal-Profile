    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Henry Messiah TMT, a clinical pharmacist with a strong foundation in research, data analysis, and problem-solving skills I’m now channeling into the tech industry. With a Master’s degree in Clinical Pharmacy (in progress) and years of experience optimizing therapy outcomes, I’ve developed a sharp eye for detail, structured thinking, and the ability to translate complex data into practical solutions.

My growing passion for technology has led me to software development and digital health innovations, where I bridge my healthcare expertise with technical skills. I’m particularly interested in how tech can improve systems, streamline workflows, and create impactful solutions for real-world problems.

At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the desire to create tools that empower people. Whether in healthcare or technology, I thrive at the intersection of human needs and digital innovation.
